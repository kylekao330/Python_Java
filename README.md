Project Name: Building Birdie game using Python library **pygame**

Summary:

This project is about you being a bird and you have to blast down enemy birds. There are four different types of birds: grey, green, blue, and yellow. All the enemy birds have random speeds and they come flying in from both directions. As the player, you are a red bird and your objective is to use your fireball attack to take down these birds. Every 5 seconds, you will have the ability to launch a massive fireball by pressing "B" on your keyboard towards the enemy birds. Unlike regular fireballs, this massive fireball pierces through the enemy birds. However, if any enemy birds touch you, you lose and you are taken back to the home screen.
