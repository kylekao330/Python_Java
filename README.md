Project Name: Birdie using **pygame** libary

Summary:

In this game, you are a green bird and your objective is to flap in between massive poles and to try not to hit them. Pressing the spacebar key on your keyboard makes your bird character flap once, so you will have to press the spacebar consecutively in order to maintain flight. There is also a score function, where there are coins scattered across the area and you have to touch the coin in order to obtain it. Obtaining the coin results in plus 1 to your score. The game does not last forever, however, because there is a countdown of 20 seconds and you have to survive for those 20 seconds in order to beat the game. However, if you touch one of the massive poles or fail to maintain flight, you will lose and will be directed to the main menu.
